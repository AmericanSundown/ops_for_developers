For this lesson, you should be ssh'd into your Virtual Machine (Virtual Machine) you created in the previous lesson.

We will now be running commands both on your VM and local machine.

If you need to run a command on your VM, it will be denoted like this:

```bash
(On VM) $ cd this_directory
```

If you need to run a command on your local machine, it will be denoted like this

```bash
(On local machine) $ cd this_directory
```
