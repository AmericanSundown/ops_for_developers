Operations for Developers
==================

At the 2014 Chef Community Summit, I helped lead a session on training developers without a sysadmin background Chef.

I came from a development background myself and found Chef when I became responsible for my own QA, Staging, and Production systems.  The learning curve was very high, especially because so many of Chef's resources are geared toward Sysadmins new to development rather than developers new to system administration.

This experimental curriculum attempts to help fill this need.  It is very much a work in progress, if you'd like to contribute feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request, I welcome contributions and input!
